# River Raid 2k

It's a intuitive remake *game* of [River Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Raid).
The motivation is just fun in coding, there is no commercial purpose.

Live Preview: https://joaoneto.github.io/river-raid-2k/

Features:
1. Nice decouple, (not for performance)
1. Pseudo-engine based on Unity classes
1. Infinite and procedural map loop
1. Sprites pixel matrix to base64 images
1. Colisions detection in sprite width / height

Enjoy ;)
